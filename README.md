# CPP-in-SDVN
This project provides the codes of an cost-effctive Controller Placement Problem in Software-Defined Vehicle network.  
Include  
*  SDVN platform  
*  Improved Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm and Improved Multiple-objective Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm (package improved ABC & IMABC)  
# Support  
*  Python 3.8.0  
*  Matlab 2016a    
# Install  
*  The SDVN platform can be obtained directly(documents except package improved ABC & IMABC)  
*  The Improved Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm and Improved Multiple-objective Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm can be obtained from package improved ABC & IMABC    
# Detail    
 *   .tcl is the vehicle movement file
 *   Node.py is the class for node (vehicles) in the network  
 *   sdvn_controller.py is the class for controller in sdvn  
 *   Four CPP schemes can be chosen from cover_test.py  
 *   All parameters can be modified in Global_Par.py
 *   improved ABC algorithm.m introduces the Improved Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm  
 *   Improved Multiple-objective Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm(IMABC) can be test using .m documents in IMABC package  
#  Any suggestion is welcome!
